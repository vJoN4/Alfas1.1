# Alfas1.1
2nd semester final project of "Development Center" Group, this is a simple questions and answers website made it with Django (and Bootstrap to facilite design), in this project I also used XAMPP with PhpMyAdmin for the database. For the reason that I made it in a 1080 resolution, I'll put some screenshots of the project; logically you can prove it in your own computer, but you will need to reduce the zoom of your navigator, here too I was focus on the functionality over design, but there are still details to be polished, these details were presented to me in my review of the project.
